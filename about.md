## Who the hell are you?

K97i is ~~an award-winning record producer, actor, and incumbent President of the United States.~~

**K97i is a music producer, songwriter, and crazy lunatic with a sense of humor and a spine.** I've been making music ever since the elusive year of hell that is 2019. I also like to dabble in computers and programming. On the side, I'm a high school student!

## Give me some examples of the stuff you've made

For the songs I did with [Realm of Harmony](https://www.youtube.com/@R0H),

I composed, produced, and wrote ***Farewell to the Sea***, an *orchestral rock ballad*:

Ninja's Coda, a *Christmas Rock* song:

and Out of Town, a *Pop* song with orchestral and rock elements:

I also co-produced the Council of the Crystal King Anthem, a *rock* song:

For the stuff I made for my own channel,

I made the Home EP. You can access the EP at the navbar up top or [here](/home-ep) if you're feeling lazy!

I composed and produced ***Soulless***, a *Midtempo* track:

I produced a remix for Ninjago's main leitmotif, *the Overture*:

and I made a *Future House* remix for Gideon's Middle of the Night:

For the NON-music stuff,

I help the [Spec-ify](https://github.com/Spec-ify/) group. I'm responsible for the technical aspects of Specify's UI and I'm one of the maintainers of Specified's viewer. So if anything broke on that side of the coin, that's probably me. Sorry!

I also help in r/techsupport's Discord server, so if you have a computer problem, [join the server](https://rtech.support/discord) and you may see me hanging about!

I also made this very website with Github Pages and Jekyll! This website uses a modified [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme. I spent a lot of time digging through HTML and SCSS to make this look good! You can find the source code of this website [here](https://github.com/K97i/K97i.github.io).

## The most important question: FL Studio or Ableton?

I use both. I know, cats and dogs living together, mass hysteria.
