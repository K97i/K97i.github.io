## Who the hell are you?

**~~K97i is an award-winning record producer, actor, and incumbent President of the United States.~~**

**K97i is a music producer, songwriter, and crazy lunatic with a sense of humor and a spine.** 

Music production has been my passsion ever since the elusive year of hell that is 2019, and hopefully it won't stop any time soon. I particularly like to create electronic music, specifically Midtempo, Drumstep, and Future House, though I also like to dabble in Pop-oriented tracks.

I'm also relatively proficient with computers, and like to do programming, namely JavaScript, PHP, Python, and C#. I'm an unapologetic LEGO Ninjago fan, and in real life, I'm a high school student, currently enrolled in 12th Grade!

## Give me some examples of the stuff you've made

### Realm of Harmony

The Realm of Harmony is, or rather, was a group of LEGO Ninjago fans who created fansongs for the fandom. I was a songwriter for the project in between July 2022 and September 2023.

#### We Are The Council

I co-produced and provided vocals for the infamous We Are The Council song, a *rock* song notable for the inclusion of Deven Mack, the actual voice actor for Vangelis in Ninjago.

#### Farewell to the Sea

I composed, produced, and wrote Farewell to the Sea, a melancholic *orchestral rock ballad* with vocals from YaboiFoxtale, of [pythor doesnt accept](https://youtu.be/NeCAFZUmtcQ) fame.

#### Ninja's Coda

I composed, co-produced, wrote, and provided vocals for Ninja's Coda, a *Christmas Rock* song commissioned (don't know if that's correct lol) by the Keepers of Spinjitzu fan site for its Ninjago Advent Calendar.

#### Out of Town

I composed, produced, wrote, and sang in Out of Town, a *Pop* song with orchestral and rock elements based on the newly-released-at-the-time Ninjago: Dragons Rising show's Season One.

I composed, produced, wrote, and sang in Crystalized, a *Future Bass/Drumstep* song, being the first hopeful song in the album.

### Self-released

#### Tunes from the Monastery

I made an 11-track LEGO Ninjago fan album titled "Tunes from the Monastery". You can check it out at the navbar at the top of this page, [here](/tunes-from-the-monastery) or the image below if you're feeling lazy!

#### Home EP

I made a 4-track Extended Play titled "Home EP". It spans from Future House to Synthwave to Drumstep. You can check it out at the navbar at the top of this page, [here](/home-ep) or the image below if you're feeling lazy!

#### Soulless

I composed and produced ***Soulless***, a *Melodic Midtempo* track.

#### Ninjago Overture Remix

I produced a remix on Ninjago's main leitmotif throughout the entire series, *the Overture*.

### Non-Music

I help the [Spec-ify](https://github.com/Spec-ify/) group. I'm responsible for the technical aspects of Specify's UI and I'm one of the maintainers of Specified's viewer. So if anything broke on that side of the coin, that's probably me. Sorry!

I also help in r/techsupport's Discord server, so if you have a computer problem, [join the server](https://rtech.support/discord) and you may see me hanging about!

I also made this very website using Github Pages and Jekyll! This website uses a moderately modified [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme. I spent a lot of time digging through HTML and SCSS to make this look good! You can find the source code of this website [here](https://github.com/K97i/K97i.github.io).

## The most important question: FL Studio or Ableton?

I use both. I know, cats and dogs living together, mass hysteria.
