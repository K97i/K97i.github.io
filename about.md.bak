## Who the hell are you?

K97i is ~~an award-winning record producer, actor, and incumbent President of the United States.~~

**K97i is a music producer, songwriter, and YouTuber.** I've been making music a year before the COVID-19 pandemic (I can't say "The Pandemic" anymore for futureproofing). I also dabble in computers and programming.

## Give me some examples of the stuff you've made

I composed, produced, and wrote (in that order) [**Farewell to the Sea**](https://youtu.be/kfefDBrKH34) and [**Crystalized**](https://youtu.be/w50t7xC3vVY) on the [Crystalized Fan Album](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9EtwJKX5d3EbBWYd4Ffjj8m5dm0b0VAp) by the [Realm of Harmony](https://www.youtube.com/@R0H). I also produced the [Council of the Crystal King Anthem](https://youtu.be/itqw1gI_R7M).

I am also responsible for a lot of the front-end work for [Specify](https://github.com/Spec-ify/). If anything broke, it's probably my fault, sorry.

## The most important question: FL Studio or Ableton?

I use both. I know, cats and dogs living together, mass hysteria.
