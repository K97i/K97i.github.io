## _Save all your work so that future you can reminisce and cringe._

**Development doesn't happen overnight.** Always save and backup what you make, no matter how bad the mix is. Later down the line, you can look back at these tracks and either reminisce the good old days where life was just simpler, or cringe at how bad it is.

This applies to any piece of creative work. From Minecraft Worlds to GitHub Repositories. Remember that you can always remake, rework, or revise them in the future, no matter how far that time will be.

Rephrasing the first sentence in this post, skills don't come to you overnight. But it helps if you save everything, so in the future, you can answer the question: **Did I get better?** And most importantly, *how bad was I when I started?*
