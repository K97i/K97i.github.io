### *You can, quite literally, do anything*

Imagine you're on your desk, and you think of an interesting idea. Maybe it's creating a Midtempo song for the first time, or maybe even [using a door hinge in a song](https://youtu.be/oJNZtl26iqU) (i love nate so much). 

Don't give in to the voice inside your head telling you to not do it. Seriously, go to a doctor.

**Always shoot your shot.** Sure, maybe no one's going to listen to what you make. Sure, it'll probably sound bad at the start. Sure, you might horribly miss, but you have the freedom to make literally whatever you want (within reason of course). No one's actually stopping you to go for the idea you have. You just have to start it.

Here, I used the stab from [Gideon's Vault Hunters](https://youtu.be/oMBeaZPostM) song to start a song with wubs:
