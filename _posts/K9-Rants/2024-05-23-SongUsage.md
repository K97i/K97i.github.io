# Hello!

So you'd like to use my songs in a project of yours. Thanks for listening to my stuff!

> I've experienced someone taking my work, reuploading it, hiding my name in the description and it getting more views than the original video, which is actually screwed up. If you want to know more about it, check [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/itsK97i/status/1759608237677273498).

# Non-commercial purposes

For non-commercial purposes (i.e. small passion projects, fandom videos, etc), absolutely! 

All I ask for is *proper credit*. What I count as proper credit is that it needs to be: 

1. Clear to the viewer where the music in the project comes from.

> **Good Credit** 
> Song: "Face the Race" by K97i (if on YouTube, feel free to @ me in the text!)
> 
> **Bad Credit**
> Song: "Face the Race" 

2. Be *upfront* about credit. Don't obscure it by burying it in the description under a lot of text. 

My preferred format is:

> Song: "Face the Race" by K97i
>
> Song Link: [https://youtu.be/FFDzRBjQu-M](https://youtu.be/FFDzRBjQu-M)

# Commercial purposes

Wow. Okay, didn't expect that one.

If you want to properly license the song from me, contact me through Discord! My username is `k97i`. I have direct messages disabled and I automatically filter out friend requests that come from nowhere, so join the [Foxtale Discord Server](https://discord.gg/pxvKpJVKtX) and ping me!
