# What does K9 use to make music?
{: .no_toc }

Hello! This is the page where K9 lists the equipment he uses for everything: making music, programming, and editing videos (as of 2024).

> You do NOT need what I use to make good stuff! Use and learn what you have to the fullest extent, and you'll make great things. Remember: it's not about the tool you use. **It's how you use it.**

## The Hardware

These are the main hardware I use!

### Computer

I use the [Acer Nitro V 15 (4050 Variant)](https://www.amazon.com/i5-13420H-Processor-GeForce-Display-ANV15-51-51H9/dp/B0CP8D4SM2/), which has:
- an Intel i5-13420H (4 P-cores, 4 E-cores),
- an RTX 4050 (6 GB VRAM)
- 8 GB of DDR5 RAM (upgraded to 16 GB)
- and 512 GB of NVMe Storage (probably upgrading to 2 TB!)

### Audio Hardware

I currently use two headphones: a [Samson SR850](https://www.amazon.com/Samson-SR850-Semi-Open-Back-Reference-Headphones/dp/B002LBSEQS), and a [SteelSeries Arctis 3](https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-All-Platform-Headset-PlayStation-Nintendo/dp/B07KWHL2QR). I primarily use the SR850 but I switch between the headphones for checking mixes, and use the Arctis 3 when the audio cable I soldered breaks again.

I use a no-brand USB Condenser microphone that I got from a local store. It works surprisingly well for something unbranded!

I don't use an external audio interface and just use the laptop's audio output.

### Extra Peripherals

I use a [Royal Kludge RK61](https://www.amazon.com/RK-ROYAL-KLUDGE-Mechanical-Ultra-Compact/dp/B0832NSKW7) as my main external keyboard (using stock blue switches), and a [VXE R1 Pro Max](https://www.atk.store/products/vxe-dragonfly-r1-series-wireless-mouse?variant=44857375588570) as my mouse (I mainly use my laptop keyboard tho).

## The Software

The juicy bit; the software that I use!

### Music

I use [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/) as my Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) of choice. I used to main [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/), but switched when its workflow stopped work for me as I became more and more organized with my project files.

For instruments:

- [xfer Serum](https://xferrecords.com/products/serum/) (my main synth)
- [Vital](https://vital.audio/) (my secondary synth, free!)
- [DecentSampler](https://www.decentsamples.com/product/decent-sampler-plugin/) (anything sample based, free!)
- [reFX Nexus](https://refx.com/nexus/) (THE ROMpler)
- [KORG M1](https://www.korg.com/us/products/software/kc_m1/) (the VST version of the keyboard)
- [BBC Symphony Orchestra Discover](https://www.spitfireaudio.com/bbc-symphony-orchestra-discover) (my main string VST, free!)
- [AAS Strum GS-2](https://www.applied-acoustics.com/strum-gs-2/) (the guitar VST)
- [Monster Piano](https://agushardiman.tv/monster-piano-v3-great-free-acoustic-piano-vst-with-multi-character/) (my main piano VST, free!)

I also have a [Cort AF510M](https://www.cortguitars.com/dp/standard-af510m/) guitar if I ever want to record a real guitar for my productions!

For audio effects:

- [Fabfilter's Plugins](https://www.fabfilter.com/) (general mixing, eq, reverb, etc)
- [Valhalla's Plugins](https://valhalladsp.com/) (for anything extra that's covered by FabFilter)
- [Kilohearts' Plugins](https://kilohearts.com/) (for anything NOT covered by the two above)
- [Overloud TH-U](https://www.overloud.com/products/th-u) (guitar amp used in conjunction with Strum GS-2)
- [Antares Auto-Tune Pro](https://www.antarestech.com/products/auto-tune/pro) (self-explanatory)
- [iZotope Ozone](https://www.izotope.com/en/products/ozone.html?srsltid=AfmBOopPsz1R2wXVdoZFVw-t6xordyb0Ci4uAP7-hAeXLtHgMmk3USRp) (mastering)
- Ableton's stock plugins

For samples:

- [KSHMR's Sounds of KSHMR series](https://www.dharmaworldwide.com/product-tag/sounds-of-kshmr/) (the main sample pack I use EVERYWHERE)
- Disciple's Sample Packs (for electronic-based productions)
    - Virtual Riot X Modestep Spicy Riddim Drums [Vol. 1](https://splice.com/sounds/packs/disciple-samples/virtual-riot-modestep-spicy-riddim-drums-1) and [Vol. 2](https://splice.com/sounds/packs/disciple-samples/virtual-riot-x-modestep-spicy-riddim-drums-vol-2)
    - Barely Alive Essential Samples [Vol. 1](https://splice.com/sounds/packs/disciple-samples/barely-alive-essential-samples-vol-1) and [Vol. 2](https://splice.com/sounds/packs/disciple-samples/barely-alive-essential-samples-vol-2)
    - [Fox Stevenson Universal Samples Vol. 1](https://splice.com/sounds/packs/disciple-samples/fox-stevenson-universal-samples-vol-1)
- [Vengeance Sample Packs](https://www.vengeance-sound.com/samples.php) (for anything else NOT covered)
- [Rob Late Alpha Drums 2](https://roblate.com/products/alpha-drums-2-sample-pack) (for anything acoustic that's NOT covered)

If I ever need custom samples, I just record them myself!

For editing vocals, I use [iZotope RX](https://www.izotope.com/en/products/rx.html) for audio clean-up, and [Melodyne](https://www.celemony.com/en/melodyne/what-is-melodyne) for pitch correction. Sometimes, when I need to clean a whole lot of audio and have a time constraint, I clean them with the AI-based [Ultimate Vocal Remover](https://github.com/Anjok07/ultimatevocalremovergui).

### Editing

I use [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/ph_en/products/premiere.html) to edit my videos. I used to use [MAGIX Vegas Pro](https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/vegas-pro/), but switched when it became unstable on my old computer. I also use [Adobe After Effects](https://www.adobe.com/ph_en/products/aftereffects.html) to create my spectograms.

I use [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/ph_en/products/photoshop.html) and [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/ph_en/products/illustrator.html) to do anything image related, [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/), [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/), and [VoukoderPro](https://www.voukoder.org/forum/thread/1208-voukoderpro-public-beta/) for anything video related that's not video editing, and [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/) for quick image conversions.

I use [cobalt.tools](https://cobalt.tools/) to download anything video from the internet.

### Software and Web Development

I primarily use [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) as my main code editor, switching to [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) whenever needed.

I use [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/) to control everything Git, again switching to Git Bash whenever something deep needs to be done.

(oh, and I mostly program in C#, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Python)

### General Stuff

I use [Blender 4.2](https://www.blender.org/download/releases/4-2/) and [Mecabricks](https://www.mecabricks.com/) to create my LEGO renders, and [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) as my main browser.
